# Guidelines
- [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)


# Package managers
- [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com) - Node Package Manager
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) - is a superset of NPM that stores the exact versions of dependencies, installs packages in parallel

# Version managers
- [Nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) - a Bash script
- [n](https://github.com/tj/n) - Node module, which can be installed by npm

# Build Tools (Bundlers)
Module Bundling, on a high level, is a process of integrating together a group of modules in a single file so that multiple modules can be sent to the browser in a single bundle (which is good for performance but bad for debugging).
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) - a modular build tool
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - gives you “blazing fast” bundling as it uses multiple worker processes to ensure that the compilation process is executed in parallel on multiple cores without the need of any configuration

# Development frameworks
- Angular
- ReactJS
- Vuejs

# IDEs
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - open sourced IDE supporting many languages. Built on top of Webkit
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - A sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)

# Libraries

## Module Loaders
A module loader is typically some library that can load, interpret and execute JavaScript modules you defined using a certain module format/syntax, such as AMD or CommonJS.
- [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) - Configurable module loader enabling backwards compatibility workflows for ES modules in browsers.
- [RequireJS](https://requirejs.org/) - is a JavaScript file and module loader.
- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) - Browserify lets you `require('modules')` in the browser by bundling up all of your dependencies.

## State managers
- [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) - application architecture that Facebook uses for building client-side web applications. It complements React's composable view components by utilizing a unidirectional data flow
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - A predictable state container for JavaScript apps
- [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) - Simple, scalable state management
- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) - state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications

## Testing frameworks
- [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) - open-source BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be paired with any javascript testing framework
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - test framework, comes with built-in mocking and assertion abilities, runs your tests concurrently in parallel, providing a smoother, faster test run
- [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)  - "batteries included" BDD test framework, does not require a DOM
- [Headless chrome](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md) - tool for automated testing and server environments where you don't need a visible UI shell
- [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) - a browser test runner
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) - not a "complete" test framework, covers the basics and allows developers to extend it with other frameworks; running on Node.js and in the browser
- [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)  - headless Web Kit used for automating web page interaction. 2018: ABANDONED
- [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) - open source web-based automation tool for web applications across different browsers and platforms
  - [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) - enables you to use a programming language in creating your test scripts (not possible in Selenium IDE)
- [Sinon](https://sinonjs.org/) - Standalone test spies, stubs and mocks for JavaScript. Works with any unit testing framework

### Testing stacks
- [Automated testing with Headless Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/06/headless-karma-mocha-chai) - Headless Chrome, karma, mocha, chai

#### Karma + Webpack
- [istanbul-instrumenter-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/istanbul-instrumenter-loader) - Instrument JS files for subsequent code coverage reporting
- [karma-junit-reporter](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-junit-reporter) - Reporter for the JUnit (JavaScript unit tests) XML format.
- [karma-htmlfile-reporter](https://github.com/matthias-schuetz/karma-htmlfile-reporter) - a karma plugin for exporting unit test results as styled HTML file
- [karma-spec-reporter](https://github.com/mlex/karma-spec-reporter#readme) - Test reporter that prints detailed results to console (similar to mocha's spec reporter).

## Task runners
Common tasks include things like watching file changes, concatenating/minifying files, prefixing files for different browsers, and linting Javascript.
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)
- [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/)

## Transpilers
Transpilers - Source-to-source compilers, tools that read source code written in one programming language, and produce the equivalent code in another language
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io) - converts new JS code into old ones
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html) - TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## CSS preprocessors
CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique syntax.
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS pre-processor with syntax advancements (older syntax)
- Scss - CSS extension, preprocessor which lets you use features that aren’t a part of the wider CSS standard yet, and provides better workflows for maintaining your stylesheets
- [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) - Expressive, robust, feature-rich CSS language built for nodejs

## CSS Layouts
CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they are positioned relative to their default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around them, their parent container, or the main viewport/window.
- Normal flow
- The `display` property
- Floats
- Positioning
- Table layout
- Multiple-column layout
- Flexbox Layout - new layout mode in CSS3
- Grid Layout

# Terminology
- CSS vendor prefixes (CSS browser prefixes) - a way for browser makers to add support for new CSS features before those features are fully supported in all browsers.
- Polyfill - type of shim that retrofits legacy browsers with modern HTML5/CSS3 features usually using Javascript or Flash.
- Shim - any piece of code that performs interception of an API call and provides a layer of abstraction. It isn't necessarily restricted to a web application or HTML5/CSS3.
- Tree shaking - in javascript context, refers to dead code elimination

## JavaScript
- [Closure](https://gist.github.com/AllThingsSmitty/9a5463870d12c62fc33b#3-closure) - inner function, that's accessible outside of its outer function's scope, with its connection to the outer function's variables still intact.
  - [Closures are not complicated by T.J. Crowder, 2009](http://blog.niftysnippets.org/2008/02/closures-are-not-complicated.html)
- [Curring](https://gist.github.com/AllThingsSmitty/9a5463870d12c62fc33b#4-currying) - using multiple functions with single arguments, in place of a single function with multiple arguments
- [Hoisting](https://gist.github.com/AllThingsSmitty/9a5463870d12c62fc33b#5-hoisting) - default behavior of moving declarations to the top
- [Mutation](https://gist.github.com/AllThingsSmitty/9a5463870d12c62fc33b#5-hoisting) - referring to the changes that DOM elements went through
